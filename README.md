# Linear_eqautions_solver
Program containing implementation of 3 methods used to solve systems of linear equations: Gauss-Seidl method, Jacobi method and special version of LU factorization. File sprawko.pdf contains basic theoretical information about algorithms, methods of counting their efficiency and charts presenting complexity of operations on matrices of various size

File Plotter.py contains class that handles plotting linear charts that present algorithms efficiency.

File Matrix.py contains class Matrix. It is class that enables creating matrices of diffrent sizes, default values
and diagonal characteristics. Handling of basic operations on matrices is also provided.

File Solver.py contains implementation of Gauss-Seidl method, Jacobi method and special version of LU factorization, that is dedicated to operations on banded matrices.

File ErrorManager.py contains simple implementation of counting resisuum  of counted solution and later counting second norm of it.
